At this time, you can let us know whether the class will be extended or terminated, and if you wish to extend the class, you must inform the company at least 7 days before the end date, and if not, the class is considered to be terminated.",

After 4 weeks of class, it is impossible to take a break for several weeks and proceed again, and it will be treated as the termination of the class. If you wish to retake the class after the end of the session, you can wait for a new class registration and rejoin the class."
